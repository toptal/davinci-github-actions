# Reusable Github Actions

Reusable Github Actions for davinci based applications

## Overview

Actions are the building blocks that power your GH workflow.

This repo represents a library of reusable GH Actions you can use in your GH workflows.

Actions in this repo were specially created to use in [davinci](https://github.com/toptal/davinci)-based applications.


## Example

This is a simple example of using GH Actions. Here, we execute two GH Actions:
* yarn install
* danger check

```
jobs:
  danger:
    name: Check:Danger
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: toptal/davinci-github-actions/yarn-install@v3.0.1

      - uses: toptal/davinci-github-actions/danger@v3.0.1
```
